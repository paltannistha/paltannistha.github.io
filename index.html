    <p style="text-align: left">
      I'm interested in Data Science. I have worked extensively with machine learning and data mining techniques to infer marketing insights and forecast sales. I
      was responsible for using data visualization techniques in varius companies to increase the usability and accessibility of data for the
      sales and marketing departments. Working closely other departments has allowed me to hone my interpersonal skills and the
      ability to present complex technical information to non-technical personnel.
