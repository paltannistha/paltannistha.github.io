Here's some basic text.

And here's some _italics_

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:

- First item

* Second item

- Third item

Here's a numbered list:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:

```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:

```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg" alt="linearly separable data">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$

{% include figure class="centered" url="/assets/images/proj.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/perceptron/percept.jpg" alt="A two year old walking" %}

# How to render math equations on your Minimal Mistakes

### Katerina Bosko, PhD

[view solution](https://www.cross-validated.com/How-to-render-math-on-Minimal-Mistakes/)

You need [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) if you want to render mathematical equations on your Minimal Mistakes website.

I first learned about it from [the blog post by Peter Willis](http://www.pwills.com/posts/2017/12/20/website.html) (thanks, Peter!) However, I couldn't enable MathJax even after following his instructions. So here's what I did.

### 1.

Add this snippet at the end of the `scripts.html` which is in the `_includes` folder:

```html
{% if page.mathjax %}
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script
  id="MathJax-script"
  defer
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"
></script>
{% endif %}
```

The [MathJax documentation](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted) says that with this snippet you won't need to change anything with each new version of MathJax.

### 2.

Enable MathJax in `_config.yml` by adding `mathjax: true` to the page defaults

```yml
# Defaults
defaults:
  # _posts
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      read_time: true
      comments: true
      share: true
      related: true
      mathjax: true
```

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note:** If you are using Docker, don't forget to rebuild your container after making changes to `_config.yml`.

```
docker build -t minimal-mistakes .
```

## Playing with Maths

Basically that's it. Try rendering \\(y_0\\) using `\\(` and `\\)` delimeters for inline equations.

Use `\\[` and `\\]` to display equations like this one:

\\[ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz \\]

LAtex

```latex
\\[ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz \\]
```

TeX

```tex
\\[ f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz \\]
```

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

TeX/LaTeX

```tex
$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$
```

k*{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k*{n-1}

TeX/LaTeX

```tex
k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}
```

<i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i> **Note:** If things don't work, check if the MathJax script is added to the page using Developer tools.
